### Date created
July 31, 2025

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project allows users to explore data related to bike share systems in three major US cities: **Chicago, New York City, and Washington**. 
 
The program is run via the command line and uses Python and the pandas library to read and analyze bikeshare data based on user input.  
Users can filter the data by city, month, and day of the week, and receive useful statistics such as:
- Most frequent times of travel
- Most popular stations and trips
- Trip duration stats
- User demographics (gender, birth year)

### Files used
- `bikeshare.py`: The main Python file containing the logic of the program.
- `chicago.csv`: Raw bikeshare data for the city of Chicago.
- `new_york_city.csv`: Raw bikeshare data for New York City.
- `washington.csv`: Raw bikeshare data for Washington.
- `.gitignore`: To prevent uploading large data files to GitHub.
